        Gig workers who earn income through online platforms like Uber, Lyft and GrubHub are feeling the full pain of elevated gas prices, which recently peaked at a national all-time high, according to AAA. Their income is fixed to how much time they’re willing to invest on the road, and as they pay more at the pump, gig workers are reconsidering whether it’s worthwhile.<br>
        <br>Because they’re classified as independent contractors, gig workers cover all the costs associated with driving, from vehicle insurance to car maintenance, while having no cushion against spikes in the price of gas.
        <br><br>Gig work for online platforms is common throughout the U.S. and for millions of adults. A recent study conducted by the Pew Research Center surveyed over 10,000 Americans and found that 1 in 10 people over age 18 had earned income through gig work facilitated by an online platform within the past year.
        <br><br>Some have decided to reduce the number of hours they drive each day because of gas prices, while others have sought out more fuel-efficient cars, and a few drivers have even put gig work on pause entirely.
        <br><br>Companies like Uber and Lyft have responded by announcing surcharges on orders placed through their apps. Uber recently announced their platforms will pay 35 to 55 cents more per trip or order, depending on the location. And for the next couple of months, drivers in most places will earn an additional $0.55 per ride while using Lyft.
        <br><br>Erin Hatton, Associate Professor of Sociology at the University at Buffalo, who’s an expert on labor and gig work, said companies aren’t too concerned about gas prices forcing people to leave their platforms because they know there will always be people out there who are always willing to work for less.
        <br><br>“For those workers who really are struggling to make ends meet, or maybe struggling to pay for their children's college, they’re hustling to make ends meet wherever they can,” said Hatton. “At the end of the day, these companies are all about making a profit and not at all about treating workers well.”
